# Second Postmodern Lab 

##The Task
OOP.

1. Design and implement a solution with one or several classes with interface-based API for one of the tasks listed below.<br />
2. Cover the classes you've introduced with unit tests.<br />
3. Push it to your GitHub repository for code review.<br />
4. [Optional] Set up automatic per push unit tests running in your repository.<br />

Variant: <br />
** Implemet Bezier curve(any) **

##Introduction


A Bezier curve is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields.<br />
A set of discrete "control points" defines a smooth, continuous curve by means of a formula.<br />

In general case we have such formula:<br />




This project was built in Unity using C#. The main feature here is that it's possible <br />
to make a Bezier Curve almost any order. In fact the highest order is 68(than overflow comes).<br />
Also it's possible to add points by mouse clicking.<br />
Some additional preferences available like LineWidth, StartPoints, <br />
Number of points from wich our curve is contained.
